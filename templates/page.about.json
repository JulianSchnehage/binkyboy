The sizing was always wrong, caricatures dominated the fabrics, and the coolness factor was at a point of non-existence.</p>",

We truly believe that kids are legendary--but their cost don't need to be. <br/><br/>This foundation originated as Matt and Rachel tried to have kids for several years with no luck. It wasn’t until they had a successful IVF cycle that Jordy was born. Not only was Matt and Rachel’s first son, Jordy, born through IVF, but the next three (Bodee-Parks, Blakely-Rose, and Jude-Rylan) were all from the IVF process as well--four kids 3-years old and under. The total cost for all of those children was easily over $55,000 in total. A sum that most couples in their young 20's don't have access to.<br/><br/>Matt and Rachel always thought if the opportunity came to help others in this process they would. More to come here very soon!</p>",
